Plain text here.

.md extension refers to markdown.

Markdown is an easy way to write a readme

We need to commit the changes below in order to "save" the new version of the file

Under commit changes, the one line text indicates what you want to happen. i.e. for a new file, it will say create readme.md. For subsequent updats it may automatically say update readme.md

This can be edited to be more descriptive


Some more changes I am makin from my main pc :)
